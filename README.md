# Code to Create Value

Code to Create Value or CTCV is an idea, a philosophy, for everybody who knows how to code. No matter what language you use, no matter what your experience or background is, if you have the power of coding, you should use it to create something valuable for the world. 
Doesn't matter if it's used by nobody, you are not a company selling it's product, you are simply a person who wants to make projects, maybe for practising their skills or [just for fun](https://justforfunnoreally.dev/), which is useful in something.

The main thing to focus on is the intention, and not the outcome. Pure intentions are what most people lack, and that's the reason for corruption and all kinds of bad things. You should practise not only professional skill, but also a life skill. CTCV is about this only.



You will be successful, if when in the last moments of your life, you get a smile when you feel that you tried your best to do good things, to add value, to make others happy.
